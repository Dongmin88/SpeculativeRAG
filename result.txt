Question: Tell me about Paris, focusing on its significance as a global city.
Answer: Paris is globally significant due to a multitude of factors. As the capital and largest city of France, it hosts an estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 2021 [1]. This high population density, combined with the estimated 12,262,544 residents of the wider Paris Region or ÃŽle-de-France in 2019 [1], reflects Paris's status as a key urban area.

Furthermore, Paris's cultural significance is underscored by its status as a hub for art and heritage. It is home to several renowned museums, including the Louvre Museum, which features globally recognized works such as the Mona Lisa [2]. This cultural richness attracts a large number of tourists from all over the world, with the city receiving approximately 30 million visitors each year [2].

The combination of these factors, including its high population, cultural wealth, and status as a tourist destination, make Paris a city of global significance.
